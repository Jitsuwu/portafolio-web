  WELCOME

<h2>
  My name is Marco Estrada, and I have created this portafolio
</h2>

<p>
  With the help of Alura Latam X Oracle courses I was able to create my own HTML and CSS website/portafolio from scratch!
<br>
  I know it sounds kind of crazy but it's real!
<br>
  If by any chance this code helps you with starting your own website or learning CSS and HTML, feel free to let me know, is my pleasure to be helpful
<br>
